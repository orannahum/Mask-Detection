# Mmaskditection

There are data files here that need to be opened using a ZIP file. The data was prepared by the roboflow website.
The only thing that needs to change is the line:
DIRECTORY = r "/ content / drive / MyDrive / Colab Notebooks / mask data (less)"
Each according to the location of the data.
For questions and problems you can contact me by email: oranne5@gmail.com
Good luck!
